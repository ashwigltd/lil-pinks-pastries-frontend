							<h2>How Long We Store Personal Data</h2>

							<br />While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that
							users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be
							insecure at times and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond
							what is reasonably practical.

								age has provided us with personal data their parent or guardian may contact our privacy
